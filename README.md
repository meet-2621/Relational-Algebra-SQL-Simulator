# 🎓 Relational Algebra Operations Simulator (SQL Project)

This mini DBMS project demonstrates how **Relational Model** and **Relational Algebra** concepts can be implemented practically using SQL.  
It includes hands-on examples for operations such as **Selection, Projection, Joins, Union, Intersection, Difference, Cartesian Product, Division**, and **Relational Calculus**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Understood how theoretical relational algebra maps to SQL queries.  
- Practiced **JOIN**, **SET**, and **FILTER** operations in a real database.  
- Improved knowledge of **SQL constraints, keys, and relationships**.  
- Strengthened understanding of **DBMS fundamentals** for labs and interviews.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Schema creation for a *University Database*  
- Sample data for Students, Departments, Courses, and Enrollments  
- SQL examples for:
  - **Selection (σ) and Projection (π)**
  - **Union, Intersection, Difference**
  - **Cartesian Product**
  - **Theta, Inner, Left Outer, Right Outer, and Natural Joins**
  - **Division (÷)**
  - **Tuple and Domain Relational Calculus**
